p193,2/24/2017,Minshan Mountains Project,"Minshan Mountains is one the most important giant panda distribution areas in China. A nature reserve system has been established in this area for the giant panda conservation. We have surveyed mammals and pheasants from 2004 using cameras and sign transects. The surveys are scatterly distributed from 2004 to 2016. Outside the nature reserves, there are still large forest areas embedded in a human-dominated landscape, which probably function as both habitat and movement corridor for many animals. We surveyed potential corridor areas with remote cameras based on the same survey protocol as our previous survey projects, in order to identify key habitats for connecting isolated areas and will aid in corridor design.",Bill McShea,mcsheaw@si.edu,Bill McShea,mcsheaw@si.edu,Bill McShea,mcsheaw@si.edu,32.60993,104.18109,CHN,
